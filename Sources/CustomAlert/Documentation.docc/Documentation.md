# ``CustomAlert``

In iOS Alerts cannot contain Images or anything other than Text. This allows you to easily customize the message part with any custom view.

While the alert is completely rebuilt in SwiftUI, it has been designed to look and behave exactly like a native alert. The alert uses it's own window to be displayed and utilizes accessibility scaling but with the advantage of a custom view.

If the content is too large because the text is too long or the text doesn't fit because of accessibility scaling the content will scroll just like in a SwiftUI Alert.
